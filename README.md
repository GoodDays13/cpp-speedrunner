# C++ Speedrunner
A personal project of a game where you can change the speed of time to beat levels quicker
## Compile
### Dependencies:
- CMake
- glslc
- xxd
### Process:
Just the typical process for compiling CMake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
out/speedrunner
```
A `speedrunner` executable will be in build, but this is an intermediate. The final is in out.
